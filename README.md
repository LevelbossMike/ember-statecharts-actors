# statechart-actors

This app demonstrate how we can use [ember-statecharts](https://ember-statecharts.com/) and XState's [actor](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/actors.html#actors) feature together.

The demo-use case:

- Show a blog posts overview page
- When a blog post's detail view is accessed details will be "requested" in the
  background - while this is happening the app is still responsive
- When a blog post's details have already been loaded this behavior won't
  retrigger
